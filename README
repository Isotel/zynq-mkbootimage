Zynq mkbootimage

This is an open-source replacement for the Xilinx bootgen application.
It parses a .bif file and creates a Zynq boot image in .bin format.

It is written entirely in C.

Required C libraries: pcre, libelf.

To build this application run:
make

To use it, type in:
./mkbootimage <in_bif_file> <out_bin_file>

Currently it supports creating boot image containing fsbl, bitstream
and u-boot.

Linux images/devicetrees/ramdisks are not yet supported.

Encryption certificates are not supported.
