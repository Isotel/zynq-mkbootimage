Zynq mkbootimage

This is an open-source replacement for the Xilinx bootgen application.
It parses a .bif file and creates a Zynq boot image in .bin format.

It is written entirely in C.

Required C libraries: pcre, libelf.

To build this application run:
make

To use it, type in:
./mkbootimage <in_bif_file> <out_bin_file>

Currently it supports creating boot image containing fsbl, bitstream
u-boot, and linux related binary files.

For loading linux related images, both the [load] and the [offset] attributes
are supported.
As opposed to the original bootgen, the file extensions are not required.

For example the following .bif file:

the_ROM_image:
{
  [bootloader]fsbl.elf
  fpga.bit
  u-boot.elf
  [load=0x2a00000]devicetree.dtb
  [load=0x2000000]uramdisk
  [load=0x3000000]uImage
}

will generate a bin image which can be used in u-boot, as follows:
bootm 0x3000000 0x2000000 0x2a00000

Encryption certificates are not supported.
